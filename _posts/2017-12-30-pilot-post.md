I want to use this blog for sharing my thoughts. Being a Programmer, it's mostly going to be technical stuff I guess. But you would surprised to know how random my thoughts can be.

I have been seeing lots of sites created using [Jekyll][jekyll-website] and [Github Pages][github-pages] these days. After giving it a try, I liked it and I created this site. I think people in Technical fields will like it. Because it's some technical things involved.

If you don't know how it works, there are some good resources out there.

* [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub by JONATHAN MCGLONE][jonathan-mcglone]
* [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages by Barry Clark][barry-clark]

There are lots of [Jekyll themes][jekyll-themes] out there too if you don't want to style your blog yourself. I chose [whiteglass][whiteglass].

What's next? A blog needs to have commenting and some analytics. After  whiteglass took care of Google analytics, I just had [to plug][disqus-jekyll] Disqus for commenting. It's like using microservices.

I guess I am all set for now. Here we go.  


#### Update (2018-01-07)
Actually I was facing some issues in making this blog live on hussaintamboli.github.io. [@Yous][yous-github] (the author of whiteglass) [helped][issue-link] me out.
